  <h1>Furosion Event Rules</h1>
  <p><strong>Version:</strong> 2025.1 — These rules apply to all in-person Furosion-branded events unless explicitly stated otherwise on the official event page at <a href="https://furosion.com" target="_blank">furosion.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>1. Attendee Age</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All participants must be under 18 on the day of the event. No exceptions.</li>
    <li>The suggested minimum age is 8. Children younger than this are discouraged due to safety, stamina, and maturity requirements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Clothing & Dress Code</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Furry- and therian-themed apparel is encouraged: tails, ears, masks, animal-inspired outfits, etc.</li>
    <li>Partial or full fursuits are allowed but not recommended for forest or muddy terrain due to damage and safety risks.</li>
    <li>All attire must be age-appropriate, non-sexualized, and safe for movement and visibility.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Safety and Group Conduct</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No yelling, running, throwing objects, pushing, climbing, or dangerous behavior.</li>
    <li>No engaging with members of the public without their consent. Shouting or making contact with strangers is banned.</li>
    <li>Romantic affection such as hand-holding or hugging is allowed. Any sexual behavior, including groping or graphic discussion, is prohibited.</li>
    <li>All participants must follow the lead of the group, remain within safe distance of staff, and notify someone if they intend to leave early.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Forbidden Items</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not bring: alcohol, drugs, vapes, cigarettes, fireworks, weapons (real or replica), pornography, or anything illegal under Slovak or international law.</li>
    <li>Organisers reserve the right to inspect bags or belongings and prohibit any item without explanation.</li>
    <li>Only certified service animals are permitted. Pets are not allowed due to risk of injury or being stepped on.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Photography and Consent</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Photos and videos will be taken throughout the event by organisers and attendees.</li>
    <li>By attending, you automatically consent to appearing in public-facing media. If you do not wish to be photographed, do not enter areas where cameras are active.</li>
    <li>No request to opt-out, blur, or remove photos will be accepted.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Health Guidelines</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If you are ill, especially with contagious symptoms or a positive COVID-19 test in the past 15 days, do not attend.</li>
    <li>Minor health needs (first aid kits, tissues, water) are encouraged, but the event does not provide medical personnel or liability coverage.</li>
    <li>Notify a volunteer or organiser if you feel unwell. The organisers are not responsible for medical outcomes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Personal Items</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You may bring water, snacks, a bag, plushies, gifts, art, or other safe items.</li>
    <li>Do not bring valuables. Furosion is not responsible for lost, damaged, or stolen property.</li>
    <li>Item trading and sharing is allowed, but not enforced or guaranteed safe.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Volunteers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Volunteers are selected in advance and are all under 21 but aged 13 or older.</li>
    <li>Volunteers may remind attendees of rules, assist with navigation, carry group items, and help organisers with safety checks.</li>
    <li>Volunteers may not enforce bans or expel participants — only core organisers can do so.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Violations and Removal</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Breaking any rule may result in being asked to leave immediately.</li>
    <li>If a participant refuses to leave when asked, they will be permanently blacklisted from future events, and their parents or guardians may be contacted.</li>
    <li>Failure to comply with exit requests may result in local authorities being notified for trespassing or public endangerment.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10. Disclaimers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Attendance is entirely voluntary and at your own risk. You acknowledge that the event is unofficial and not hosted by a legal entity.</li>
    <li>Furosion does not carry insurance or medical licensing and assumes no liability for harm, illness, injury, or loss.</li>
    <li>Attendees are expected to behave with maturity, common sense, and kindness. All decisions by staff are final.</li>
  </ul>
